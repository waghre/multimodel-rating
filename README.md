# Multimodal Rating Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing structured financial/market data and unstructured text data to predict company ratings using machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Œ Features:
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features.
- **NLP Feature Engineering**: Cleaning text, extracting numerical representations, and performing sentiment analysis.
- **Model Development**: Training models using structured-only, text-only, and combined data.
- **Evaluation & Insights**: Assessing model performance and interpreting results.

## ðŸ›  Requirements:
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebook. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Running the Notebook:
1. Load the dataset (`Artificial_Data.xlsx`).
2. Run all cells sequentially for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
3. Review the model performance and feature importance results.

## ðŸ“Š Models Implemented:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **knn**
-**Decision Tree**
-**Naive Bayes**
-**XGBoost**
-**Neural Network**
